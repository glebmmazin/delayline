# Non-blocking digital delay line

This repository provides data and supplementary material to the paper **Non-blocking programmable delay line with minimal dead time and tens of picoseconds jitter**, preprint: [arXiv:2105.09183 [physics.ins-det]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09183), by Glib Mazin, Aleš Stejskal, Michal Dudka, and Miroslav Ježek.

All datasets that were obtained during charecterization of the device are included here. The data are written to .xlsx files and consequently processed and visualized in Jupyter Notebook which is also a part of the repository. Package [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used to read xlsx files; alternatively, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) can be used.

Furthermore, we include a table with the [detailed comparison of digital delay lines](https://github.com/glebmmazin/delayline/blob/main/DDLs_comparison.pdf), both research-grade and commercially available ones.
