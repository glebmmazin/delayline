# Non-blocking digital delay line

This repository provides data and supplementary material to the paper **Non-blocking programmable delay line with minimal dead time and tens of picoseconds jitter**, by Glib Mazin, Aleš Stejskal, Michal Dudka, and Miroslav Ježek, Review of Scientific Instruments 92, 114712 (2021), [DOI:10.1063/5.0056828](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0056828), preprint: [arXiv:2105.09183 [physics.ins-det]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09183), 

All datasets that were obtained during charecterization of the device are included here. The data are written to CSV files and consequently processed and visualized in Jupyter Notebook which is also a part of the repository. Packages Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas are required.

Furthermore, we include a table with the [detailed comparison of digital delay lines](https://github.com/glebmmazin/delayline/blob/main/DDLs_comparison.pdf), both research-grade and commercially available ones.
